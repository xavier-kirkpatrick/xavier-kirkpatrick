### Hi there 👋

💻 I'm a software developer based in Auckland, New Zealand. 

👨‍🔧 Previously I worked as a mechanical technician at Toyota before making the switch to tech.  

📌 Pinned to my profile is a selection of projects I have worked on while at Dev Academy in 2023. 

👨‍💻 Tech excites me as an ever-changing landscape and I'm always looking for new technology to learn.

🔭 I’m currently working on a web based synthesiser using midi and the web audio API. 

🧬 When I'm not coding I'm experimenting with music software and researching music technology.
