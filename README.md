### Hi there 👋

💻 I'm a software developer based in Auckland, New Zealand. 

👨‍🔧 Previously I worked as a mechanical technician at Toyota before making the switch to tech.  

📌 Pinned to my profile is a selection of projects I have worked on while at studying in 2023. 

👨‍💻 Tech excites me as an ever-changing landscape and I'm always looking for new technology to learn.

🔭 I’m currently working on my personal web presence and portfolio to continue learning new technologies and enhance my programming ability. 

🧬 When I'm not coding I'm experimenting with music software and researching music technology.
